# Steam Discount Bot 

This JavaScript code fetches a list of all Steam games using the Steam Web API, and then sends another API request to get a list of discounted games. It then outputs a list of the discounted games, including their name, discount percentage, and final price in the local currency. The Steam Discount Bot can be used to keep track of Steam sales and make it easier to find games on sale.

## Requirements

To use the Steam Discount Bot, you will need the following:
- A Steam Web API key. You can obtain a key from the Steam Dev Site.
- A web browser with JavaScript enabled.
- An internet connection.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter your Steam Web API key in the input field and click "Fetch Discounted Games".
3. Wait for the bot to fetch the list of discounted games.
4. View the list of discounted games, including their name, discount percentage, and final price in the local currency.

## Customization

If you want to modify the bot or use it in your own project, feel free to do so! You can edit the code in `app.js` to add or remove features, or use the Steam Web API to build your own Steam-related applications.
